			<h1>Adam Wood</h1>
			<p> Computer Science Student at <a href ="https://www.buffalo.edu" target="_blank"> Buffalo </a> </p>

<p1> I'm a freshman at the University at Buffalo looking to get my degree in Computer Science.
  I aspire to get an advanced degree in Cyber Security before starting my career in the field.
  People usually describe me as an attentive, conscientious, and hard working student who is
  reliable and dedicated. In addition, I am interested in the stock market and investing in real
  estate on my free time. </p1>
  <p2> In high school, I took various college-level courses starting my freshmen year. In addition
  to AP Calculus and AP Biology, I took many engineering courses including Design and Drawing for Production
  which dealt with drawing and 3D modeling using CAD, Principles of Engineering which introduced many
  Mechanical, Electrical, Systems, and Structural Engineering concepts, Digital Electronics which was
  primarily built around Electrical Engineering using circuits (breadboards), and an introductory Computer
  Science course where I was introduced to programming in Java. </p2>
